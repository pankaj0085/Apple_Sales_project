## Project Overviewüìä And Analysisüîç

The project encompassed a comprehensive business intelligence analysis of Apple product data, leveraging SQL (MySQL) for data preparation and deep analytical querying, and Power BI for creating a visual dashboard. The initial phase involved establishing a structured apple_products table to store key metrics like pricing, customer ratings, reviews, and RAM specifications. A critical data cleaning step was executed to ensure data integrity by removing all rows containing null values. The analysis focused on answering five key business questions, including identifying the most popular product based on the highest number of ratings, determining products priced above the average sale price, and finding the top five best-selling products by review count. Furthermore, the project examined product performance by category, calculating the best and worst star ratings for each RAM type, and identifying the top three most expensive products within each RAM category. The final output was a Power BI dashboard (apple dashboard.pbix) that visually presents these data-driven insights to stakeholders.
The core of this project focused on analyzing Apple product data using SQL and Power BI. 
Key analytical goals included identifying the most popular product by number of ratings, determining which products were priced above the average sale price, and listing the top five best-selling products based on customer reviews. 
Furthermore, the analysis categorized products by RAM, calculating the best and worst star ratings for each type, and ranking the top three most expensive products within every RAM category using a window function. These SQL results were then used to power a comprehensive "apple dashboard" created in Power BI.


## Key Insights üí°

## 1. Product Demand and Market Performance
   - Most Popular Products: The analysis directly identifies the product with the highest number of ratings, providing a clear indicator of the most popular item in the dataset.
   - Top Sellers: By ranking products based on the number of reviews, the project reveals the top 5 best-selling products, which is crucial for inventory, marketing focus, and understanding consumer engagement.

## 2. Pricing and Segmentation Strategy
   - Premium Segment Identification: The project established the average sale price and identified all products priced above this average, offering insight into the company's premium product segment and overall price positioning.
   - Category Cost Leaders: By isolating the top 3 most expensive products within each distinct RAM category, the analysis pinpoints the highest-margin or most feature-rich offerings in specific technical segments.

## 3. Category-Specific Quality and Ratings
   - Quality Extremes by Specification: Grouping by the RAM type, the analysis provides insight into customer satisfaction and product quality by determining both the best-rated (highest star rating) and worst-rated (lowest star rating) product within each category. This helps engineering and product teams target improvements for underperforming specifications.


## TOOLS USED üõ†
 1. MySQL
 2. Power BI and DAX

    
## Key SQL Questions ‚ùì
Q1. Find the product with the highest number of ratings.

Q2. Find all products priced above the average sale price.

Q3. Get top 5 best-selling products based on number of reviews.

Q4. Find the best and worst-rated product for each RAM type.

Q5. Top 3 most expensive products in each RAM category.


## CONCLUSION ‚úÖ

The SQL phase ensured data quality through null value removal and performed targeted analysis to answer key business questions. These analyses successfully identified high-performing products (most-rated and top 5 best-selling) and segments (products above average price). Crucially, the analysis offered category-specific insights by grouping products by RAM, revealing the highest and lowest-rated items within each segment and identifying the top three most expensive products in each category.

The final deliverable, the Power BI dashboard synthesizes these findings into a visual, interactive format, allowing stakeholders to easily grasp product popularity, pricing tiers, and quality performance metrics across the product portfolio.

In conclusion, the project provides a strong analytical foundation for decision-making related to marketing investment, pricing strategy, inventory management, and product quality improvements for Apple's diverse product range.
